# You do not have to be an engineer to build your own

These are the components I used to build my own, then helped a friend build their own.

## Parts list:

1. [Raspberry Pi](https://vilros.com/collections/raspberry-pi-boards/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b)  
2. [SD Card]
    
2. [GPYes 2.0 u-blox 8 USB GPS Unit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0716BK5NT)
  If you rather the GPS sensor be external, you can use a [VK-162 unit](https://www.amazon.com/Onyehn-Navigation-External-Receiver-Raspberry/dp/B07GJGSZB9) instead.
    Personally, I started with the external one due to it being cheaper and regretted it - I ultimately bought the GPYes one to make my flight back more manageable
3. [Pre-configured SDRs (Software Defined Radios)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076GWVNHS)
4.

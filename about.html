title: About Us
description: >-
  We are two friends who have known each other since middle school. One took the career path as an Electrical Engineer
  while the other took a path as a Software Engineer.

    Pete decided to get his Private Pilot License at the age of 41 and naturally
    wanted to use his general aviation headset with X-Plane and PilotEdge.net's Live ATC for practice. Looking at the
    existing options on the market costing $90-$120 he thought - that's insane! So, instead of spending $100, he
    took his RadioShack soldering iron from high school, asked John about things like noise filtering and DC-DC
    converters and then software guy had created a physical prototype. Thousands of dollars and uncountable hours of
    investment later - their wives were putting up with pallets of the devices in the basement.
